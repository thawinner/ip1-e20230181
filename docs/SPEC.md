# ShopStock — Specification

Storage inventory for a small shop: storekeepers record goods coming into storage and going out to the shop, report losses and count stock; the manager approves write-offs and counts, manages accounts, and sees a reorder list and a monthly report (which can be downloaded) on the dashboard. Everyone has a My profile page.

## Roles

| Role    | Who                       | What they can do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Menu (home page first)                                                                |

## User stories

Status values: `Not done` / `Done` (updated at each check).

### US-01 · Add a storekeeper account (Manager) — Status: Not done

As a manager, I want to add a storekeeper account so that a new employee can use the system.

- AC1: With a name, a username (3–20 lowercase letters or numbers), a phone number (for example 012 345 678) and a temporary password (8+ characters with a letter and a number), the account is created active and appears in the staff list as "must change password".
- AC2: A username already in use shows "This username is already taken"; a phone number already in use or in the wrong format shows a message under the field.
- AC3: There is no public sign-up page; register without a token returns 401, and with a staff token 403.
- AC4: At first login, the storekeeper is sent to "Set your new password" and cannot open other pages until a new password is saved.

### US-02 · Log in (Both) — Status: Not done

As a user, I want to log in so that I see the pages for my role.

- AC1: Correct username and password take staff to /products and a manager to /manager/dashboard; the user stays logged in after a page reload until the 1-hour session ends.
- AC2: A wrong username or a wrong password shows the same message, "Invalid username or password", and no token is stored.
- AC3: A deactivated account sees "This account is deactivated" and cannot log in.
- AC4: Staff see only Products, Count stock and My movements in the menu; a manager also sees Dashboard, Approvals, Reorder list, Movements, Staff, Categories and Suppliers. Opening a page of the other role shows a 403 page with a link back to the home page.
- AC5: Any user can change their password with their current password; a wrong current password shows "Current password is incorrect".
- AC6: Clicking their name in the menu opens My profile: their own name, role, username, phone and date added, a Change password button, and what of theirs needs attention; no other user's phone number is shown.

### US-03 · Find a product (Staff) — Status: Not done

As a storekeeper, I want to search and filter products so that I can quickly see what is left in storage.

- AC1: The list shows 10 products per page with SKU, name, category, quantity and unit, and page controls.
- AC2: Typing "coca" shows only products whose name or SKU contains "coca", ignoring upper and lower case.
- AC3: Filters (category, supplier, low stock only) combine with the search; an empty result shows "No products match your search".
- AC4: Products at or below their reorder level show a low-stock badge.
- AC5: Staff see quantity and unit but not the cost price or stock value; the API response for staff has no costPrice field.

### US-04 · Record a delivery (stock in) (Staff) — Status: Not done

As a storekeeper, I want to record goods that arrive in storage so that the stock count goes up.

- AC1: A whole quantity from 1 to 10,000 with reason PURCHASE or RETURN_FROM_SHOP is saved, and the product's quantity increases by that amount without a page reload.
- AC2: A quantity of 0, a negative number or a decimal shows "Quantity must be a whole number from 1 to 10,000".
- AC3: An archived product cannot receive stock; the message "This product is archived" is shown.
- AC4: A PURCHASE needs a supplier, preset to the product's supplier, and may have an invoice number; the form keeps both for the next product of the same delivery, and both show on the movement.

### US-05 · Send stock to the shop or write it off (Staff) — Status: Not done

As a storekeeper, I want to record goods leaving storage so that the stock count stays correct.

- AC1: A TO_SHOP stock out decreases the quantity at once.
- AC2: Taking out more than is in stock is refused with "Not enough stock: only N left", and the quantity does not change.
- AC3: If the quantity drops to the reorder level or below, the product appears in the manager's reorder list at once.
- AC4: While typing, the form shows the result, for example "Stock after: 8 (now 12)", so mistakes are caught before saving.
- AC5: DAMAGED, EXPIRED or RETURN_TO_SUPPLIER needs a note ("A note is required for this reason"); a storekeeper's is saved as Pending and changes the quantity only when the manager approves it; a rejection shows its reason.

### US-06 · See my movements (Staff) — Status: Not done

As a storekeeper, I want to see the movements I recorded so that I can check my work at the end of a shift.

- AC1: My movements page lists only my movements, newest first, with their status (Applied, Pending, Rejected and why), filterable by type and date.
- AC2: Opening another staff member's movement by URL (/movements/:id) shows the not-found page (the API returns 404).
- AC3: A movement has no edit or delete button; the page explains that mistakes are fixed by a stock count approved by the manager.
- AC4: On a product page, staff see its recent movements (date, type, change) without the names of who recorded them.

### US-07 · Manage products (Manager) — Status: Not done

As a manager, I want to add, edit and archive products so that the catalogue matches what the shop keeps in storage.

- AC1: Creating a product with a unique, well-formed SKU adds it to the list with quantity 0.
- AC2: A duplicate SKU shows "SKU already exists"; a wrong format shows "SKU must look like DRK-0001".
- AC3: A product needs a storage unit (CASE, BOX, BAG, PACK or PIECE), a cost price of 0 or more, and a target level higher than its reorder level; otherwise a message is shown under the field. Changing the cost price affects only new movements; earlier movements keep their cost.
- AC4: A product with movements cannot be deleted; the message suggests archiving it instead.
- AC5: A staff user cannot create, edit or delete products (the API returns 403).

### US-08 · Counts and approvals (Both) — Status: Not done

As a storekeeper, I want to count stock and report losses, and as a manager, I want to approve them in one place, so that the system matches what is really in storage.

- AC1: The Count stock page lists products not counted for the longest time first; the count screen shows the product name and unit but not the system quantity, and a storekeeper's count is saved as pending.
- AC2: The Approvals page shows pending write-offs (product, quantity, reason, note, who) and pending counts (counted, expected, difference, for example 18, 20, −2), with a badge in the menu; approving applies the change, and a count also sets the last-counted date.
- AC3: Rejecting needs a reason, which the storekeeper sees in their movements or counts; nothing changes in stock.
- AC4: A second count for a product that already has a pending count is refused with "This product already has a count waiting for approval".
- AC5: Staff cannot approve; a manager's own counts and write-offs are applied at once; nobody can record an adjustment directly (the API refuses it).

### US-09 · Reorder list and monthly report (Manager) — Status: Not done

As a manager, I want to know what to order and how storage changed this month so that I can reorder in time and see losses.

- AC1: The reorder list shows products at or below their reorder level, grouped by supplier with phone number (products without a supplier under "No supplier"), with quantity left and a suggested order (for example 3 left, target 20, order 17).
- AC2: The menu shows a badge with the number of products to reorder.
- AC3: The dashboard opens on this month's report; what is waiting (approvals, products to reorder) is shown by the badges in the menu, and the report can be downloaded as PDF or CSV for the chosen month.
- AC4: For a chosen month, the report shows stock in and out per category, the top 5 products sent to the shop, the total stock value, and losses (approved damaged, expired and returned goods, and negative adjustments) with their value; a month with no movements shows zeros.

### US-10 · Manage staff, categories and suppliers (Manager) — Status: Not done

As a manager, I want to control who can use the system and how products are grouped.

- AC1: The manager can activate or deactivate a staff account, but not their own ("You cannot deactivate your own account"); a deactivated user is logged out on their next action.
- AC2: The manager can create, edit and delete categories and suppliers; deleting one that still has products is refused with "Move or delete its products first".
- AC3: A staff user cannot change staff accounts, categories or suppliers (the API returns 403).
- AC4: The manager can edit a storekeeper's name, username and phone number, and reset their password to a new temporary one; the manager never sees a storekeeper's own password.

## Advanced feature (Check 6): search, filter and pagination

Applies to US-03. Limits, which are tested:

| Limit       | Expected behaviour                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Page size   | 10 by default; limit above 50 is capped at 50                             |
| Page number | page below 1 is refused with 400                                          |
| Search      | Case-insensitive, matches name or SKU; an empty search shows all products |
| No result   | Shows "No products match your search" instead of an empty table           |

## Changes after the first version

Made while building the mockup; the proposal (`docs/ShopStock_Project_Proposal.docx`, section 10) has the same list.

| #   | Change                                                                                                                                                     | Where                          |

| C-4 | (should) Product photo on the product form, shown in the list and detail page (category picture when none); Product gets `imageUrl`                        | PRD-1, PRD-7, data model       |
| C-5 | User gets `createdAt`, shown as "Added" on the staff list and My profile                                                                                   | data model                     |

Roles, business rules BR-1 to BR-19 and their messages, the advanced feature and the out-of-scope list are unchanged.
